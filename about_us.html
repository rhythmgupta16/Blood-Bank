A blood bank is a center where blood gathered as a result of blood donation is  stored and preserved for later use in bloodtransfusion. The term "blood bank" typically refers to a division of a hospital where the storage of blood product occurs and proper testing is performed (to reduce the risk of transfusion related adverse events). However, it sometimes refers to a collection center, indeed some hospitals also perform collection.Whole blood or blood with RBC, is transfused to patients with anaemia/iron deficiency. It also helps to improve the oxygen saturation in blood. It can be stored at 1.0 °C-6.0 °C for 35–45 days.
