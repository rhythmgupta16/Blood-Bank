<center><h1>Tips for a Successful Donation</h1></center>
<fieldset>
<p><strong>Before Your Donation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the days before your donation, eat healthy, iron-rich foods such as spinach, red meat, fish, poultry,&nbsp;beans, iron-fortified cereals and raisins. This will help maintain a healthy iron level. The number one&nbsp;reason for deferrals (especially women) is anemia</li>
<li>Get a good night’s sleep</li>
<li>At least 3 hours before donating, eat a balanced meal and avoid fatty foods, such as hamburgers,&nbsp;fries, or ice cream</li>
<li>Drink an extra 16 oz. of water and fluids before the donation; you can be deferred for dehydration</li>
<li>Remember that your system must be free of aspirin for three days (72 hours) or ibuprofen for 24 hours&nbsp;prior to donation</li>
<li>Remember to bring a valid photo ID, a list of medications you are taking, and a list of places you have&nbsp;visited outside of the U.S. in the past 3 years</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>During Your Donation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wear clothing with short sleeves or sleeves that can be raised above the elbow</li>
<li>If you have a preference of arm or vein that you like the phlebotomist to use for your donation, let them&nbsp;know</li>
<li>Relax, listen to music, talk to others, or simply just catch up on some reading on our comfortable donor&nbsp;lounge chairs designed specifically for apheresis donations, which are equipped for our donors to surf&nbsp;the internet or watch movies</li>
<li>Enjoy an assortment of refreshments in our canteen area immediately after donating</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>After Your Donation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Drink plenty of fluids over the next 24-48 hours to replenish any fluids you lost during donation</li>
<li>Avoid strenuous physical activity or heavy lifting for about 24 hours after donation</li>
<li>If you feel light headed, lie down, preferably with feet elevated, until the feeling passes</li>
<li>If something doesn’t feel right, call the Donor Center’s toll-free number provided to you after your<br>
donation</li>
<li>Enjoy your day and know that you have made a positive difference!</li>
</ul>
